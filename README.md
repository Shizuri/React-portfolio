## Portfolio Website

The project was developed with the use of these **React** technologies: **Functional Components**, **Hooks** and **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**.
The routing animations were created with the use of **[React Transition Group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group)**.
**[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** was used to bootstrap the project.
All of the design was created by me with the use of **[Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)** and **[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)**.
